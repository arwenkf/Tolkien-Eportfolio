    <p>Like in the phto I took above, we can often see the beginnings of things before they fully come into fruition.
        This was, upon my second readthrough, a huge part of what mentions of legends or stories in the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> did
        for me. They foreshadowed events that were to come, making true the phrase "history repeats itself".
        <br><br>
        For example, during the Council of Elrond chapter in the <em>Fellowship of the Ring</em>, 
        Elrond tells of the original forging of the rings. He tells everyone who is about to set off on this journey about
        how Sauron tricked his followers, how he "ensnared them with knowledge," then betrayed them by making the 
        One Ring behind everyone's back. He didn't appear outwardly evil, and used this to manipulate everyone. The second time 
        reading through this, this seems like such poignant foreshadowing for Sarumon (who likely intentionally shares a similar name). 
        As a member of the Wise, Saruman is able to hide his treachery for a long while, before we learn he captured Gandalf. This cycle 
        of evil is always bound to repeat, which is why the characters must use the knowledge gained from these legends to help them in the 
        future.
