        Tolkien fought in World War 1, eventually having to leave not by his own will, but 
        beacause of a bad case of trench fever. He then went on to use this experience to create 
        compelling characters and story-lines in the <em>Lord of the Rings</em>. Although this isn't necessarily
        a legend, what it shows me is that one's past, experiences, and knowledge (in a way their own "lore"), 
        has a huge impact on who they are as a person (See the <a href="ents.html">Ents page</a>). This inspired
        me to create the work you see below.
