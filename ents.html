    <p style="font-size: larger;">As I read through the <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, I felt deeply connected 
    to the Ents. I felt that they are a perfect example of how huge an impact legends and 
    history hold in Tolkien's world. As we meet these creatures, we see how Merry and Pippin
    struggle because of how slow they speak. This is because in the Ent's language, every word 
contains an entire history. The language grows as they do. This is seen particularly in their names, which
tell the entire story of their life. This speaks clearly to how everyone's story is constantly growing and 
evolving with everything they do. <br><br> There was also a particularly wonderful moment in which we 
see the Hobbits directly putting themselves into legend. The Ents have an old song that lists all of the 
creatures of Middle Earth, and, after their encounter with Merry and Pippin, the Ents vow to add them to the 
song; the hobbits created their own place in legend.</p>
