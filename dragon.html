    <div style="padding:5px; text-align: center;">During this trip, our instructor read to us a talk that Tolkien gave on dragons. This talk was originally meant for children,
        though Tolkien didn't feel it was too big of a success. What stood out to me about this, however, was the commentary Tolkien
        gave on his creation of dragons in his stories. He put dragons, culminated from many different mythologies (Norse, Greek, etc.) 
        into his books, and thus inserted them into the legends of our world that he crafted. He also, in the talk, discusses how remnants
        of dragons can still be seen in the roads we drive on today. This is what inspired the image above. 
        <br><br>
        In this talk, he tells us what dragons are, describing their nature and role. He describes them as monsters and horrors of old, snake-like 
        reptiles who may breathe fire and are, as a rule, entirely malicious and greedy. Inspired by this description, I created the poem below,
        subverting this idea of entirely evil dragons. Here, they are compared more to wild animals, who are just protecting themselves, going against
        the lore Tolkien has created for them.

        <pre style="text-align: center; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif; font-size: 1.1rem;">          Rumors

            Someone has told me of dragons, of monsters, of stories
            
            Think back, to the point where monsters roamed the Earth
            
            Can you imagine? The fire flows through the quarries,
            
            Their breath turning towns, cities, homes, into nothing of worth
            
             
            
            “Greedy,” they whisper, pointing to the Dragon’s mountain of gold
            
            The dragon looks and huffs steam, he roars and screams 
            
            They chase him with swords and discuss valor, but all told
            
            Is this what they deserve? Do they not also have dreams?
            
             
            
            Call me a romanticist, call me just truly wrong
            
            But is a crow shamed for their jangling of keys?
            
            Is a hamster shamed for carrying all their food along?
            
            Does danger, does size create unease?
            
             
            
            I think you look lovely, I say burning in place
            
            I’m sorry that we have treated you this way
            
            As I fade to dust, I want to give you grace
            
            I hope that your memory doesn’t decay
            
             
            
            Like I’m certain mine will.</pre>
