        <p id="intro-para">Welcome! This portfolio is a summary of a Tolkien-focused class I took in Oxford (where he
            taught and studied!) this past winter semester.
            In this portfolio, I hope to showcase to my friends and instructors what I learned over this course, though
            of course everyone is welcome. During this
            trip I had a quest: I wanted to find out what role legend and lore play in the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> as
            well as Tolkien's work as a whole. This, over the course
            of the class, diverged into two parts. Legend impacts the characters and their story in the books, yes, but
            Tolkien is also creating legends for our own world.
            Everything these characters do is inherently connected to us.

            Here is a portion of the work I completed over the course of this trip! Thank you for reading, and
            feel free to scroll down and click through whatever catches your interest.
